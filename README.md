# SauceCon 22 - This Old Test Framework

Hello! If you're reading this you are either attending my workshop at SauceCon '22 called This Old Test Framework as part of the [API Testing and Monitoring](https://saucecon.com/workshops/) workshop, or at least interested in API testing and Sauce Labs. Thank you for your interest!

This workshop makes use of the wonderful 
[My Demo App Android](https://github.com/saucelabs/my-demo-app-android), using this Android app as a starting point. I'll show the following using this application as a base:

- An example of testing an API service directly instead of using a UI testing approach
- An example of using API services in E2E test scenarios, and
- How to replace a UI test with an unit test.

So let's get started!
